		introParagraph: "The Spotify API is home to an incredible wealth of information about artists, albums, and songs, as well as individual Spotify users. If you are a Spotify user, you know obviously know how amazing it is to have access to almost any music ever released in one place. As a developer, it is exciting to know that all that information is available for you to use, too. But not in the snap of a finger. If you have not tried your hand yet at developing an app using the Spotify API, this article will attempt to tackle some of what you can expect, and hopefully help you decide if the effort is worth your time.",

But one of those difficult teacher tasks is gathering data, as a means to guide your instruction, along with a way to show parents that you know their children well. As a teacher, I was always hoping to find the balance of a fun, engaging app that actually taught my students, while giving me some information about them after they finished.",
